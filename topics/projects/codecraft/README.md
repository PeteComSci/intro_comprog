# Python Programming Project for CodeCraft Project

### Objective:

Create a Python program that exemplifies foundational computational thinking skills by implementing core programming constructs without relying on built-in functions.

---

### Requirements:

1. **Functions:**
   - Craft at least four unique functions (e.g., `calculate_average`, `find_maximum`) that perform essential tasks within your program.
   - Do not use built-in Python functions for these tasks – code them from scratch.

2. **Conditional Logic:**
   - Implement at least two complex if-else statements that handle multiple user input scenarios or program conditions.

3. **Operators:**
   - Use arithmetic and logical operators to process data, such as calculating averages, maximums, or minimums.
   - Explicitly avoid Python's built-in functions like `max()`, `min()`, or `sum()`.

4. **Loops:**
   - Utilize both `for` and `while` loops to demonstrate your ability to control program flow efficiently.
   - Include examples of iterating over data structures without using built-in functions.

5. **CLI Menu Interface:**
   - Develop a user-friendly command-line interface that guides the user through your program, with clear options and feedback.
   - Implement manual error handling and input validation.

6. **Lists:**
   - Show meaningful use of lists, employing them for tasks such as storing datasets, user inputs, or processing information.
   - Manually implement any list manipulations like modifying the elements and searching.

7. **In-line Comments:**
   - Your code must include comments that explain the purpose and logic of your code blocks, functions, and loop constructs.

8. **Problem-Solving:**
   - Your program should solve a real-world problem or automate a task, reflecting your ability to apply computational thinking to life scenarios.

### Directions and Submission:

- Talk to the teacher as soon as possible about your application idea to get approval before you begin.
- Plan and design a draft CLI Menu layout (on paper) of the program.
- Develop the program with ALL the requirements above. There will be additional points detection if you do not meet all the criteria.
- Test and debug the program.
- Ask your friends or family members to test the program. Gather feedback from them to improve your
application.
- Create a short video (must be between 5 to 7 minutes) with a brief explanation of your program's functionality and your thought process in designing the solution, including quick explanations of some of the complex codes. Speed up the video if it is longer than 7 minutes.
- Video needs to demonstrate all the functions and how the program is meeting all the requirements.
- Include some testing for invalid data inputs and error recovery in the video.
- You can upload your .py file directly to the assignemnt and skip this: "Commit and push your Python file with a clear file name indicating the project via GitHub Assignment."
- Upload the video demonstration file to the Google Assignment to submit the assignment.
- Self-assess your project using a form provided at the end of the assessment. (link will be available next week)
- Do peer-assessment for at least 3 other students with meaningful feedback. (2 things that you really link and 1 thing that could be better)

### Assessment:

Your project will be graded based on the rubric provided below. Pay close attention to the criteria to ensure you meet the expectations for the grade you aim to achieve.


> [!NOTE]
> Embrace this project as an opportunity to demonstrate your creativity, logical reasoning, and mastery of Python basics. Happy coding!


> [!CAUTION]
> You may use additional tools and techniques from online resources but you must still meet the above requirements and also cite the sources properly in the code where they are used. Reasonable/appropriate use of those tools will be considered as exceptional performance when all other requirements are met exceptionally well. Unreasonable use of them will earn no point or minus points if the requirements are not met.

### Grading Standards and Rubric

Every criterion will make up an approximate percentage of the grade given to a single programming problem as indicated in the "Approx. % of Grade" column. Points will be assigned for a particular criterion roughly along the lines of the guidelines of the “Exceptional". “Good", “Average”, and "Poor" evaluations. Final percentage will be converted to an IB grade.


| **Criterion** | **Approx. % of Grade** | **Exceptional (100%)** | **Good (85%)** | **Average (75%)** | **Poor (60%)** |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Specific Functions** | 20% | 4+ well-defined functions manually performing tasks such as calculating averages, finding max/min values, without using Python's built-in functions. Clear naming conventions and minimal redundancy. | 4 functions cover core tasks including manual implementations of basic list processing tasks. | 4 functions present, some overlap in functionality or implement basic tasks using built-in functions. | Fewer than 4 functions, or functions do not work properly or contribute significantly. |
| **Conditional Statements** | 20% | 2+ complex if-else statements handling scenarios like list item validation or user choice logic without using Python's built-in functions. | 2 effective if-else statements handle user inputs or program states without relying on built-in functions. | 2 if-else statements present, handling only basic conditions, possibly using built-in functions. | Incorrect use of conditional statements, or limited handling of scenarios, possibly with incorrect use of built-in functions. |
| **Operators Usage** | 15% | Uses arithmetic & logical operators to manually calculate statistics (mean, median, mode) and perform list manipulations. No reliance on built-in functions for these operations. | Correct use of operators to perform necessary calculations and list manipulations, may include manual implementation of searching algorithms. | Basic use of operators for simple calculations; use of built-in functions for list processing. | Incorrect or limited use of operators; reliance on built-in functions for basic calculations or list manipulations. |
| **Loops Utilization** | 15% | Uses for, while, and possibly nested loops to manually iterate over lists for tasks like searching or copying without using built-in functions. | Uses at least two types of loops correctly for tasks such as iterating over lists or generating repeated user prompts. | Uses loops, but with limited complexity or efficiency; may rely on built-in functions for tasks that could be manually coded. | Ineffective use of loops, leading to inefficient code, or incorrect implementation of manual list processing. |
| **CLI Menu Interface** | 10% | CLI menu is exceptionally intuitive with manual error checking and user input validation, no use of built-in functions to handle menu logic. | CLI menu is functional with manual implementation for user interaction, minimal use of built-in functions. | CLI menu is functional but may not be intuitive; relies on built-in functions for input validation or error checking. | CLI menu is confusing, difficult to navigate, or relies heavily on built-in functions for basic functionality. |
| **List Implementations** | 5% | Demonstrates a sophisticated use of lists, manually implementing features such as searching algorithms, finding unique items, or manual list reversals without built-in functions. | Effective use of lists to store and manipulate data, including manual implementations of basic list functions. | Basic use of lists, but may not fully leverage their capabilities or relies on built-in list functions. | Limited or incorrect use of lists, with heavy reliance on built-in list functions for simple tasks. |
| **In-line Comments** | 5% | Comments provide comprehensive explanations of manual implementations of algorithms and logic, enhancing understanding of complex coding principles. | Comments describe manual code implementations and decision-making, providing context and aiding understanding. | Comments are present but may not fully explain manual implementations or the logic behind decisions. | Sparse or uninformative comments, with little to no explanation of manual implementations or logic. |

> [!CAUTION]
> A 1% grade deduction will occur for each minute of video presentation time over or under the required length. The teacher will specify the acceptable range.
