**Key Aspects of Using AI Chatbot Responsibly and Creatively:**
- **Debugging Code:** Students should use the AI Chatbot to help understand error messages and debug code. The AI should assist in explaining complex errors and suggest ways to troubleshoot them, but students must implement fixes themselves.
- **Brainstorming:** The AI Chatbot can be used to help generate ideas for project components such as features, UI/UX designs, or flowchart logic. Students should use these sessions to expand their creative thinking and explore diverse solutions.
- **Learning New Skills:** Students are encouraged to use the AI Chatbot to learn new programming concepts or refine their skills. The chatbot can provide explanations, examples, or resources on advanced topics, enhancing their learning experience.
- **Ethical Use:** Students must ensure they use the AI Chatbot ethically. This includes not using the chatbot to perform tasks they are assigned to complete themselves, like writing chunks of code for their projects directly. It’s important to use the tool for learning and assistance, not to replace their own work.
