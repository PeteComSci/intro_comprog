# Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. In this module, "Algorithms," we will delve into the foundational algorithms that are pivotal in the field of computer science and software development. We'll explore sorting algorithms, which are used to organize data in a specific order, and searching algorithms, which are designed to retrieve information from data structures efficiently. Additionally, we'll introduce the concept of recursion, a powerful tool for solving problems by breaking them down into simpler, more manageable sub-problems. Understanding these algorithms will not only improve your problem-solving skills but also enhance your ability to write efficient and optimized code.

### Topics Covered:

1. **[Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/PeteComSci/intro_comprog/tree/main/topics/algorithms/sorting_algorithms)**
   - **Bubble Sort:** Learn this simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
   - **Insertion Sort:** Understand this algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time, placing each element in its proper place.

2. **[Searching Algorithms](https://github.com/PeteComSci/intro_comprog/tree/main/topics/algorithms/searching_algorithms)**
   - **Linear Search:** Explore this straightforward approach, where you look for an element by checking each element in the list until the desired element is found or the list ends.
   - **Binary Search:** Dive into this efficient algorithm that repeatedly divides the search interval in half, used especially with sorted arrays.

3. **[Recursive Algorithms](https://github.com/PeteComSci/intro_comprog/tree/main/topics/algorithms/recursive_algorithms)**
   - Get acquainted with the principle of recursion, where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
   - Understand how recursion is used in various algorithms and the importance of base cases to prevent infinite loops.
