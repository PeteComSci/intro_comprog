# Parallel Lists

Parallel lists are a fundamental concept in programming, especially useful when you need to maintain relationships between different sets of data without using more complex data structures like dictionaries or objects. Each list holds a different type of information, but related elements are aligned at the same index positions across these lists. This organization allows for a structured way to access and manipulate related data points.

Imagine planning a trip where you have a list of destinations, the cost associated with each, and activities available at each destination.

**Python Example:**
```python
destinations = ["Paris", "Tokyo", "New York"]
costs = [1000, 2000, 1500]
activities = ["Sightseeing", "Shopping", "Museums"]

for i in range(len(destinations)):
    print(f"Destination: {destinations[i]}, Cost: {costs[i]}, Activity: {activities[i]}")
```

#### Why Use Parallel Lists?

Parallel lists are particularly handy in scenarios where you're dealing with related datasets that are conceptually distinct but need to be processed together. For example, if you're handling data where each entry involves a name, a date, and a specific value, keeping these as parallel lists ensures that you can access all related information by using a single index.

#### Simple Practical Example

Consider a scenario where you're managing a classroom: you have students, their grades in math, and their attendance percentage. Using parallel lists, you can easily organize and manipulate this information.

**Python Implementation:**

```python
students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
grades = [88, 92, 75]
attendance = [90, 95, 80]

# Displaying each student's details
for i in range(len(students)):
    print(f"{students[i]}: Grade = {grades[i]}, Attendance = {attendance[i]}%")
```

## Manipulating Parallel Lists

Manipulation of parallel lists involves adding, removing, or modifying elements in a synchronized manner across all lists to maintain the relationship between them.

### Adding Elements

When adding new data, it's crucial to update all lists to keep the parallel structure intact.

```python
# Adding a new student
students.append("Diana")
grades.append(85)
attendance.append(88)

# Verify the addition
print(students, grades, attendance)
```

---

### Removing Elements

To remove data, you must ensure that the related elements are removed from all lists, typically by using the same index.

```python
# Remove the third student (Charlie)
index_to_remove = 2
del students[index_to_remove]
del grades[index_to_remove]
del attendance[index_to_remove]

# Verify the removal
print(students, grades, attendance)
```

---

### Modifying Elements

Modifying elements in parallel lists requires updating the specific indexes across all lists.

```python
# Improve Bob's grade and attendance
index_to_modify = 1
grades[index_to_modify] = 95
attendance[index_to_modify] = 98

# Verify the modification
print(f"Modified {students[index_to_modify]}'s Grade to {grades[index_to_modify]}, Attendance to {attendance[index_to_modify]}%")
```

---

### Searching for Elements

Finding elements involves iterating over one list and using the current index to access related elements in other lists.

```python
# Find and display Bob's details
search_name = "Bob"
if search_name in students:
    index = students.index(search_name)
    print(f"{students[index]}: Grade = {grades[index]}, Attendance = {attendance[index]}%")
else:
    print(f"{search_name} not found.")
```

Parallel lists provide a simple yet powerful way to manage related data sets. They are particularly useful in situations where using more complex data structures is not necessary or would add unwanted complexity. Proper manipulation of these lists, as shown through the examples above, ensures data integrity and accessibility, making them a valuable tool in a programmer's toolkit.
